## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the server `npm run serve`

## App features:

- Connectes to a fake backend which loops through all of the data and displays it on the web page

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Angular

## Approach

I wanted to learn how Angular worked so how I approached it was doing a tutorial through teamtreehouse - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/angular-basics-2

It was a code along where you touch on the following:

- The anatomy of an Angular application
- How to configure webpack
- Static typing with TypeScript
- Components
- Templates
- Scoped CSS
- Attribute & Structural Directives
- Child components
- Services
- Make Http Requests

## Challenges & lessons learnt

- Struggled with understanding how all of the components linked.
- I also found some of the syntax a bit confusing I feel I will have to create some more applications to gain a better understanding
- Really enjoyed learning and working with Typescript
- Learnt how to do a GET and POST request using Angular

I feel as this was my first code along and tutorial with Angular I am going to have to keep creating more and more applications to understand it more.

## Still to do...

- I would like to impliment a Like Counter
